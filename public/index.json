This theme requires Hugo\u0026rsquo;s extended version to support SCSS compilation, so make please sure you install the extended version. For more detailed information and other methods of installation you can visit the Hugo installation guide.\nThere may be other ways to install Hugo that are more applicable for your project. For example, you can use the NPM package hugo-bin to include Hugo in a project that already uses NPM packages.\nChecking your Hugo installation Run the following command in your terminal to check if Hugo is installed. Copy\rhugo version Make sure the version name mentions extended, to indicate you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the extended version of Hugo, which is required for this theme.\nCreating a site Create a new site docs (you may choose any name you want). In your projects root folder, run the following command: Copy\rhugo new site docs This will create a new folder /docs with all required files in it.\nInstalling the theme Download and copy the theme files into /docs/themes/ace-documentation or use git to clone the repository to that directory: Copy\rcd docs cd themes git clone https://github.com/vantagedesign/ace-documentation After theme installation, the /docs/themes/ace-documentation folder should contain the file theme.toml, along with all other theme files.\nConfiguring your hugo site to use the theme Inside your site\u0026rsquo;s folder, /docs, you will find a file called config.toml. This is the configuration file for your site. Open it and configure it to use the Ace theme by setting the following value: Copy\rtheme = \u0026#34;ace-documentation\u0026#34; Installing example content You can add some sample content to your site by placing the contents of the exampleSite directory in your /docs directory.\n"

This is set in config.toml, using orderSectionsby = \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo;. Change this to \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; to sort pages alphabetically based on their title instead. Alternatively, do not assign a weight to any pages and it will also sort them alphabetically on their title.\nTable of contents By default, a table of contents (ToC) is generated for each page in the right side menu. This can be disabled using:\nCopy\rtoc = false in the config.toml or the frontmatter (a page\u0026rsquo;s markdown file) for a page-wide or page-specific disabling of the ToC respectively.\nLogo An optional site logo can be specified:\nCopy\rsite_logo = /logo.svg Google Analytics Enable Google Analytics by adding your GA tracking ID to the config.toml file, at: Copy\rgoogleAnalytics = \u0026#34;XX-XXXXXXXXX-X\u0026#34; Where XX-XXXXXXXXX-X is your tracking ID.\nRead more navigation In config.toml or a page\u0026rsquo;s frontmatter, set disableReadmoreNav = true to disable the prev/next buttons at the bottom of every page.\nSearch Disable search by setting disableSearch = true in config.toml.\nThe local search feature is based on the content of index.json, which is generated based on a configurable template. Search results are presented as a drop-down list attached to the search input field while typing.\nCustom CSS You can override the built-in css by using your own. Just put your own css files in the static directory of your website (the one in the theme directory also works but is not recommended) and modify the custom_css parameter in your config file. The path referenced in the parameter should be relative to the static folder. These css files will be added through the header partial after the built-in css file.\nFor example, if your css files are static/css/custom.css and static/css/custom2.css then add the following to the config file:\n[params]\rcustom_css = [\u0026#34;css/custom.css\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;css/custom2.css\u0026#34;] "

This will create a folder /docs/public with all the necessary files, compiled to HTML.\nBe sure the site\u0026rsquo;s configuration in config.toml is complete, including the baseURL = \u0026ldquo;https://yourdomain.com/\u0026quot; value to properly load stylesheets and other resources. Copy\rhugo Creating content Markdown Pages are written in Markdown and files defining pages should end with .md. For more information on how to use Markdown, search for tutorials on the internet or use this cheatsheet.\nFile structure Ace looks at your file structure and automatically turns it into a menu. The structure looks as follows: Copy\r/content\r├── _index.md\r├── page-top.md\r└── /level-one\r├── _index.md\r├── page-1-one.md\r├── page-1-two.md\r└── /level-two\r├── _index.md\r├── page-2-one.md\r├── page-2-two.md\r└── /level-three\r├── _index.md\r├── page-3-one.md\r├── page-3-two.md\r└── /level-four\r├── page-4-one.md\r└── page-4-two.md Your \u0026lsquo;homepage\u0026rsquo; for every level is the _index.md file. Subpages (like page-1-one.md) are automatically added as child pages in the menu.\nAn exception exists for the top level files. /content/_index.md is your homepage, and any other page files in the /content folder are not automatically added in the menu. Instead, they can be accessed manually through their URL (yourdomain.com/page-title).\nFile contents Every file should start by defining the title and weight of the page. This can be done by adding the following text to the top of your page file. Copy\r+++ title = \u0026#34;Usage\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; weight = 2 +++ The title will be displayed as a H1 header at the top of your page. The weight determines the order in the menu.\nAfter that you may write the content you desire with Markdown. You may use shortcodes to add some more \u0026lsquo;advanced\u0026rsquo; layout features to the page, such as code highlighting, a \u0026rsquo;lead\u0026rsquo; style paragraph, images, video\u0026rsquo;s, and more.\nNavigation bar menu While the left sidebar navigation is automatically populated by the file structure described above, and the right \u0026rsquo;table of contents\u0026rsquo; sidebar menu is automatically populated by the headings defined on a page, the top navigation bar needs to be configured manually. This can be done in the config.toml file, by adding the following lines: Copy\r[[menu.shortcuts]] name = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/vantagedesign/ace-documentation\u0026#34; weight = 10 This example will create a GitHub icon that links to that URL.
